                      <a href="https://github.com/baconpaul/BaconPlugs/">BaconMusic VCV Rack Modules</a> are my collection of modules
                      for <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCVRack</a> which focus on signal path manipluatio and quantization,
                      more antique synthesis methods, and various other not very useful things.

					  <h2>Solo Composition</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
                      I've done a variety of solo composition for piano, for piano and synthesizers, and
                      for piano, synthesizers, and recovered historical audio. Items like my
                      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/baconpaul/sets/scot-songs">Scot Songs</a> have appeared
                      in various spoken word and theatrical productions. My solo compositions are available
                      on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/baconpaul/">SoundCloud</a>.

					  <h2>Composition Kit</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
                      In 2017 I explored how I could use clojure to make a composition expression language for
                      static composition which generated organic sounding music. The <a href="https://github.com/baconpaul/composition-kit">
                        hopelessly idiosyncratic clojure software</a> which resulted allowed me to sequence music
                      like my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/baconpaul/sets/four-folk-dances">Four Folk Dances</a>
